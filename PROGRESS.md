# B.Tech Project 

## Daily Progress Update 
* **2/08/2019**
    * Finished reading dB unit conversion tutorials at [this](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jstiles/622/handouts/dB.pdf) and [this](http://www.rfcafe.com/references/electrical/decibel-tutorial.htm) link. 
* **3/08/2019** 
	* Understood basic functionality of how radio transmitter and antenna work using feeder lines to produce and receive radio waves. 
	* Basics of what is antenna gain and how it is calculated. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_gain)
	* Finished reading about link budget from [here](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/antennas-propagation/propagation-overview/radio-link-budget-formula-calculator.php) and [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_budget)
* **5/08/2019** 
	* Finished reading about link budget form [Tranzeo Link Budget Whitepaper](http://www.tranzeo.com/allowed/Tranzeo_Link_Budget_Whitepaper.pdf)
	* Finished reading [The Sky Is Not the Limit: LTE for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8337920) with few doubts.

## Doubt Section 
* **2/08/2019**
	* How does a femtocell connects to the main cellular network? How is it different from connecting a WiFi router to the internet?
* **3/08/2019** 
	* Are dBm and dBi actually different?
	* What is a dipole in an antenna?
	* Better understanding for antenna gain...
	* How antenna gain reduces interference?
* **5/08/2019** 
	* Need some more intuition on Sound to Noise Ratio.
